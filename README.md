# Neh_flowshop
Implementation of the Neh algorithm in Python

[The Neh heuristic by Nawaz et al., 1983](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0305048383900889) is dubbed as an effective greedy heuristic algorithm for flow shop problems. 

Naturally, for a flowshop problem, the search space is bounded up to $$n!$$ jobs 




In this repo you will find an easy to use Python script that implements the algorithm.
